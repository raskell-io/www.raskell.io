Hi, I'm Raffael. I live in Basel and I build automation-first platforms and edge/web ingress systems that survive production reality.

I like hard problems. The kind where latency, reliability, risk, and people all collide.
Applied security is just one arena of that. It is systems under pressure with adversarial inputs and questionable signal-to-noise.

## What I do (most days)

- Platform automation: workflows, guardrails, self-service, operability
- Edge systems: reverse proxies, policy, observability, safe change
- Applied security: reduce noise, keep humans effective, ship pragmatic controls
- Open standards: sustainable solutions over vendor lock-in

## Some threads I keep pulling on

- Making Pingora a open source alternative to established reverse proxies like Nginx, HAProxy, and what not.

## Speaking

RSAC 2026 speaker. Details soon.

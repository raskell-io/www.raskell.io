Hi, I'm Raffael. I live in Basel and I build automation-first platforms and edge/web ingress systems that survive production reality.

**raskell** = rascal × Haskell × Raffael (tanuki mascot included).

Tech that serves humans — boring by default, precise when required.

I like hard problems. The kind where latency, reliability, risk, and people all collide.
Applied security is just one arena of that. It is systems under pressure with adversarial inputs and questionable signal-to-noise.

## What I do (most days)

- Platform automation: workflows, guardrails, self-service, operability
- Edge systems: reverse proxies, policy, observability, safe change
- Applied security: reduce noise, keep humans effective, ship pragmatic controls
- Open standards: sustainable solutions over vendor lock-in

### Ushio

A traffic replay tool designed to understand edge and WAF behavior. Named after the Japanese word for "tide," reflecting how the tool replays captured traffic deterministically across environments.

**Key features:**
- HAR file support for traffic capture
- URL rewriting for staging/production comparison
- Header mutation and cookie stripping
- WAF detection and behavioral diff

**Status:** In active development

## Labs / passion projects

These are exploratory. Some will become serious. Some will stay fun.

### Terrarium

A societal simulation engine where LLM-powered agents form emergent civilizations. A societal petri dish — create worlds with rules, populate them with autonomous agents powered by language models, and observe what develops organically.

**Key features:**
- Agents with personality traits, beliefs, survival needs, and memories
- Seven core actions (move, gather, eat, rest, speak, give, attack)
- Event-sourced logging with perfect replay capability
- Dwarf Fortress-inspired terminal viewer
- Beliefs over facts — property exists only as subjective conviction

**Status:** In active development
